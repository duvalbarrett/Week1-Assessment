// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

Correct Order:

// 1) Planning
// 2) Analysis of Requirements
// 3) Design
// 4 Implementation
// 5) Testing & Integration
// 6) Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis_of_requirements = "This is the second step, in which the customer may have a general idea of what they want and the software engineer points on the pros and cons and if its possible behind the code."

const design = "This is the third step, in which once the requirements are made, the software engineer can being designing an overall idea of the modules and how the pieces are able to fit together, including the OS, language and hardware components."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers start coding according to the requirements and design that are discussed and creates the actual product."

const testing_and_integration = "This is the fifth step, to ensure that the developed systems meet all technical requirements with the components integrated and further testing occurs depending on the scope and complexity of the requirements."

const maintain = "This is the final step, which involves updating and supporting the software after it has been delivered to consumers."
